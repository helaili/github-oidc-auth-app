# github-oidc-auth-app

A GitHub App that generates a GitHub API scoped token from within an Actions workflow based on OIDC claims

# Overview
Oftentimes you need a GitHub Actions pipeline to use the GitHub API to perform some operations on another repository or organization. For example, you may want to get a container, or you may want to create a repository in a different organisation. In those cases, you need to use a GitHub API token that has the right scopes. The problem is that you cannot use the automatically provided GITHUB_TOKEN as it doesn't have enough permissions, and you don't want to use a personal access token because eithe. Those are tied to a specific humand user or to a machine account, and in both case it means generating, sharing, storing, renewing... a secret.

There is already a workaround for that with the action [peter-murray/workflow-application-token-action](https://github.com/peter-murray/workflow-application-token-action), which will deliver a short lived token that will provide access to a foreign resource on GitHub. This solution is great as there is no runtime involved, it is just the configuration of a new GitHub App, but it requires to share a private key as an Actions secret with every repository that needs to use it. You have now way to audit the usage, and a key rotation will be painful. Last, a new GitHub App will be needed whenever a different scope is needed, and you have a limit of 100 apps per organization. Having said that, again, this is still the easiest and fastest solution to the problem of granting access to a foreign resource on GitHub.

Now if none of the above solutions fit your needs, this project provides a new approach. It relies on the ability to get [an OpenID Connect (OIDC) token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) from with an Actions workflow. This token generated by GitHub contains claims (repo name, environment, actor, ref, event...) that can't be faked. Therefore we can safely pass this over to this GitHub App which will verify the claims and generate a scoped, short-lived token that can be used to access the GitHub API. This token will provide a set of permission based on a configuration file which will allow to differentiate access based on the claims. With one app deployment, a workflow in repo X can have `write` access to the content of repo Foo, while a workflow in repo Y will have `admin` access to the org Bar.

# Configuration

Those are the environment variables that can be used to configure the app:

`PORT`: **Required**. The port the process will listen to

`PRIVATE_KEY`: **Required**. The private key of the GitHub App as base64 encoded string

`APP_ID`: **Required**. The ID of the GitHub App

`CONFIG_REPO`: **Optional**. The name of the repository where the configuration file is stored. Default to `.github-private`

`CONFIG_FILE`: **Optional**. The name of the configuration file. Default to `oidc_entitlements.yml`

# Installation

## Create a GitHub App 
Follow [the instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/creating-a-github-app) to create the GitHub App. Couple things to keep in mind while creating this app:
- You need to set permissions for this app. This permissions need to be the sum of permissions of all the scoped tokens you intend to generate. You might have to review this list of permissions if you want to add a new scope later on.
- There is no need to set a webhook, a setup URL or a callback URL. You have to provide a homepage URL, but it can be anything as it will not be used.
- If you are going to use this app beyond the organisation or account that owns the app, make sure to select the `Any account` option in the `Where can this GitHub App be installed?` section. In other words, if you are going to use the app to grant access to a repository in another organisation than the owner of the app, you need to select `Any account` and not `Only on this account`.
- Note the `App ID` of the app, you will need it later on.
- Once the application created, generate a private key for this app. You can do that in the `General` section of the app settings. This key is highly confidential and will be provided as a base64 encoded string as an environment variable to the app runtime. You can use the following command to generate the base64 encoded string of the private key:

```bash
cat private-key.pem | base64
```

## Deploy the app
- Deploy the app as a runtime built with command `make build` or using [the docker container](https://github.com/helaili/github-oidc-auth-app/pkgs/container/github-oidc-auth-app).
- Configure the app with the environment variables described above.
- You can test the app by hitting the `/ping` endpoint. You should get a `Ok` response.

## Install the app
- Install the app on each organisations that will need to be accessed by the workflows. You can do that by following [the instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/installing-github-apps). Remember to select the repositories that will accessed by the app. 
- Note the installation ID. You can get it by going to the settings of the target org, click `GitHub Apps` in the left menu, then click on the `Configure` button. The installation ID will be in the URL of the page: `https://github.com/organizations/<org name></org>/settings/installations/<installation ID>`

## Create a configuration file
- Commit an `oidc_entitlements.yml` file in the `.github-private` repository (or whatever value you provided to the runtime with the  `CONFIG_REPO` and `CONFIG_FILE` environment variables) of each organisation that will need to be accessed by the workflows. The file should look like below. It is a basically an array of claims to match and the permissions to grant if the claim matches. The claims are the ones provided by the OIDC token.

```yaml
- workflow: My first worlflow
  repository: ziggy/stardust
  scopes:
    repositories: 
      - codespace-oddity
    permissions: 
      contents: write
- environment: production
  repository_owner: talkingheads
  repository_visibility: public
  scopes:
    repositories: 
      - codespace-oddity
    permissions: 
      contents: write
- repository_owner: talkingheads
  repository: talkingheads/road-to-nowhere
  scopes:
    repositories: 
      - starman
    permissions: 
      contents: read
      organization_administration: write
```
 
 If a set of claim matches several entries, the permissions will be the sum of the permissions of all the matching entries. For instance, a job targeting the `production` environment in a `public` repository named `talkingheads/road-to-nowhere` will get the following permissions:
 
 ```yaml
repositories: 
  - codespace-oddity
  - starman
permissions: 
  contents: write
  organization_administration: write
 ```


See the the `properties of permissions sections` [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/apps/apps?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-scoped-access-token) to see the list of permissions and their values.


## Use the action
The companion action [`helaili/github-oidc-auth`](https://github.com/helaili/github-oidc-auth) will retrieve the scoped token. 


```yaml
should-work-with-action:
    ...
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: GetToken
        id: getToken
        uses: helaili/github-oidc-auth@main
        with:
          installationId: ${{ vars.installationId }}
          endpoint: ${{ vars.endpoint }}
      - name: Use the token from the environment
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ env.SCOPED_TOKEN }}
        ...   
      - name: Use the token from the step output
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ steps.getToken.outputs.scopedToken }}

        ...
```
